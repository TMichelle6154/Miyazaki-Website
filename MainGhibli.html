	  	  <p>There’s no question that Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki is one of the greatest his artform has ever known. For nearly half a century 
	  he’s created some of the richest, lushest, most empowering and impactful animated films the world has ever known – Princess Mononoke, 
	  My Neighbor Totoro, Spirited Away, Howl’s Moving Castle, The Wind Rises – so much so that when Disney, that other global animation force, 
	  realized they couldn’t beat him, they joined him, acquiring his production house Studio Ghibli. </p>
	  
	  <p> Since the dawn of commercial animation, Studio Ghibli's founders, the late Isao Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki, 
		 steadfastly sustained their commitment to this philosophy: "Carefully depicting characters and their everyday life, and giving them a reality that is different from live action films, 
		 are the keys to creating a film that appeals to the hearts of the audience." And even now they still follow it. They make amazing movies and will be recognized around the world for them for it.</p>
    
	  
         <p><b>Studio Ghibli</b>, Inc. is a film studio created by Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata in 1985. It is best known for 
		 the movie <b>Spirited Away</b>, made in 2001, or <b>My Neighbor Totoro</b> and is known world-wide by many fans. Studio Ghibli has produced many movies
		 over the years and was not actively producing movies due to Miyazaki's retirement in 2014. In 2017 Miyazaki announced 
		 that he has come out of retirement to direct a new feature named<b>"How Do You Live?"</b>.</p>
